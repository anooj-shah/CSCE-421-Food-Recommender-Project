# CSCE-421-Food-Recommender-Project

Abstract:

Many are unaware of their diet and the nutritional values they are receiving in their meals. This may be about the individual nutritional content or also overall calories an individual consumes. There is quite a large range of literature about restaurant food recommendation systems. We wanted to take a slightly different view in this broad field by thinking about users trying to maintain healthy diets and cook their meals at home. Often times, users cook meals they do not enjoy or they do not know which new recipes they should try out. 
Our goal is to get a better understanding of the user's tastes and preferences to recommend food similar to the user's "flavor profile". Our plan is to first retrieve the user's taste by receiving input of various foods. The system will then output various recommendations that will provide the user with recipes they will enjoy.
